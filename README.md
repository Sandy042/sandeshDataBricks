**About This Repository**

This repository is a curated showcase of hands-on Databricks data engineering projects, exercises, and notebooks. It documents my journey as an aspiring data engineer, with a special focus on mastering cloud-scale data processing, pipeline design, and advanced analytics using the Databricks Lakehouse platform.

**Goals**

1). Demonstrate practical data engineering skills using real-world scenarios (streaming, batch processing, schema management, incremental loads, and more).​

2). Track and share learning progress in preparation for roles requiring expertise with Spark, Databricks, and cloud ETL tools.​

3). Build a portfolio to help recruiters and collaborators evaluate my capabilities in modern data workflows, pipeline orchestration, and scalable analytics.
